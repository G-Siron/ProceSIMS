# ProceSIMS

GUI Python application to process SIMS data.


## Introduction

This Python application allows to extract data from the .asc files generated by Cameca for SIMS anlayses.
It allows to evaluate if a drift correction is required for a session and can perform such fit for up to 3 standards, simultaneously, through multivariate weighted least squares.
It automatically propagate internal errors (2SE), working standard error (2SE) and uncertainty on the reference value (available when only one standard is used to correct for teh session).

## Setup

Once you have cloned or downloaded the repository, navigate through the terminal to the correct folder. It is strongly recommended to install it through a virtual environment to avoid any discrepancies with previsouly installed packages versions that you would need to run other scripts. You can do this inside a virtual environement using venv
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Then activate the virtual environement
```
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
call venv\scripts\activate.bat
```
Then, install all Python packages needed to run ProceSIMS throught he folowing command
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Run ProceSIMS

To start the application, when in the correct folder (and with your virtual environement activated if you want to work in one)
```
python3 ProceSIMS.py
```

You can then open the pdf file of the tutorial to follow steps by steps how to process your data.
